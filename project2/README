* Compilation:

The "make" command will compile all the files and make one executable mm2. 

The "make clean" command would clean any files with prefix as *~ *.o *.bak and client, server and core files.


*Assumptions:

1) We are assuming that we don't have priviledge to run as root user.
2) The TS filename accpted from the command line are not longer than 512.
3) The maximum length of a line in the TS file is 80.
4) Once the ctl-c has been pressed all the customers which are already there in the Q1 will depart from the system with a zero service time.
5) If no customer comes and the ctl-c is pressed then, no statistics is printed.
6) When ctl-c is pressed, the total sys time (theoritically) is calculated as given,

queue time + service time(0 for all the customer waiting in queue)

The customer which is being served is being served for it full time and only after that the server will exit.

7) First customer will arrive after one inter arrival time has passed as per the example given in the specs.
8) service time and arrival time is determined when the customer is created. It is as per the suggestion given in FAQ.So there is no mutex in GetInterval
as only one thread always invoke this method.
9) if rate is 0 the GetInterval will return 10000.
10) There might be chances of overflow as the data type used is long double, and the values are stored in micros.
