* Compilation:

The "make" command will compile all the file separately and link them into "sv_node" executable. 
You need to run "make" at the command prompt.

The "make clean" command would clean any files with prefix as *~ *.o *.bak and sv_node and core files.


*Assumptions:

1) We are assuming that we don't have priviledge to run as root user so resreved port numbers(<1024) is not allowed.	
2) The server will listen() with the number of outstanding connections in the socket's listen queue as 5	
3) When a number of regular nodes connect to the neighbors, the connectivity may be different between two runs.
4) The passed filename would always end with .ini.
5) We are assuming that none of the packets would be more than 512 bytes.
6) We are assuming that UOID is an "unsigned char" type.
