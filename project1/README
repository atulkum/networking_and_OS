* Compilation:

The "make" command will compile both client and server. Optionally you can also issue
"make client" for compiling client and "make server" for compiling server

The "make clean" command would clean any files with prefix as *~ *.o *.bak and client, server and core files.


*Assumptions:

1)We are assuming that we don't have priviledge to run as root user so resreved port numbers(<1024) is not allowed.	
2) the server will listen() with the number of outstanding connections in the socket's listen queue as 5	
3) If server recieve a data length longer than 512 than it will send all fail message.
4) A client will not accept data value with longer than 512 from the command line.
